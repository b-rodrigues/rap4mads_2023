## The Nix package manager

Nix is a package manager that can be used to build completely reproducible development environments. These environments can be used 
for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD environment.

If you’re familiar with the Ubuntu Linux distribution, you likely have used `apt-get` to install software. On macOS, you may have used 
`homebrew` for similar purposes. Nix functions in a similar way, but has many advantages over classic package managers. The main advantage of 
Nix, at least for our purposes, is that its repository of software is huge. As of writing, it contains more than 80.000 packages, and the 
entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor is available through Nix’s repositories. This means that using Nix, it is possible to install not only R, 
but also all the packages required for your project. The obvious question is why use Nix instead of simply installing R and R packages as usual. 
The answer is that Nix makes sure to install every dependency of any package, up to required system libraries. For example, the `{xlsx}`
package requires the Java programming language to be installed on your computer to successfully install. This can be difficult to achieve,
and `{xlsx}` bullied many R developers throughout the years (especially those using a Linux distribution, `sudo R CMD javareconf` still 
plagues my nightmares). But with Nix, it suffices to declare that we want the `{xlsx}` package for our project, and Nix figures out automatically 
that Java is required and installs and configures it. It all just happens without any required intervention from the user. The second advantage 
of Nix is that it is possible to pin a certain revision of the Nix packages’ repository (called nixpkgs) for our project. Pinning a revision 
ensures that every package that Nix installs will always be at exactly the same versions, regardless of when in the future the packages get installed.

With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace {renv} and Docker combined, or if you’re using mainly Python, you can replace `conda` or `requirements.txt`
files. If you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this can also be done easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via WSL2). 
Important remark: since using Nix on Windows must go through WSL, when we refer to "Linux" in the context of Nix, this includes Windows by default as well.
It is also possible to build multi-language environments, containing R and Python, a LaTeX distribution and packages and so on.

## The Nix programming language

Nix is not just useful because it is possible to install many packages and even install older packages, but also because it comes with a 
complete functional programming language. This programming language is used to write *expressions*, and these expressions in turn are
used to build software. Essentially, when you install a package using Nix, an expression gets downloaded from the Nix package repository
(more on that in the next section), and it gets evaluated by the Nix package manager. This expression contains a so-called *derivation*.
A derivation defines a build: some inputs, some commands, and then an output. Most of the time, a derivation downloads source code,
builds the software from the source and then outputs a compiled binary. Derivations are extremely flexible, and you could write
a derivation to build a complete environment and then build a complete reproducible pipeline. The output could be any of the 
discussed data products.

Learning the Nix programming language is a good idea if you want to contribute to the Nix package repository, but you might not have 
to learn it in-depth if you simply wish to use it to build reproducible environments, as we will learn now. If you wish to learn about
the programming language, I highly recommend [a tour of Nix](https://nixcloud.io/tour/?id=introduction/nix)^[https://nixcloud.io/tour/?id=introduction/nix].

## The Nix package repository

So, there’s the Nix package manager, the Nix programming language and the Nix package repository (henceforth nixpkgs). To look for packages click
[here](https://search.nixos.org/packages)^[https://search.nixos.org/packages]. The source code of all the packages (so 
the whole set of Nix expressions) can be found on [this Github repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)^[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs].
For example, 
[here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/libraries/quarto/default.nix)^[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/libraries/quarto/default.nix] 
is the Nix expression that contains the derivation to build `quarto`. As you can see, the derivation uses the the pre-built Quarto binaries
instead of building it from source. Adding packages to nixpkgs (or updating them) can be done by opening pull requests. For example, 
[here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/259443)^[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/259443] is a pull request to make Quarto
available to all platforms (before this PR Quarto was only available for Linux). PRs get reviewed and approuved by maintainers that also
have the right to merge the PR into master. Once merged, the new or updated package is available for download.
Because nixpkgs is a “just” Github repository, it is possible to use a specific commit hash to install the packages as they were at 
a specific point in time. For example, if you use this commit, 7c9cc5a6e, you’ll get the packages as of the 19th of October 2023, 
but if you used this one instead: 976fa3369, you’ll get packages from the 19th of August 2023. Using specific hashes is called
"pinning" and you can read more about it [here](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/FAQ/Pinning_Nixpkgs). We will make extensive use of pinning.

## The NixOS operating system, Docker and Github Actions

NixOS is a Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager as its package manager. I won’t go into detail here, but you should know it 
exists. What’s perhaps more interesting for our purposes is to use Nix within Docker. Because Nix can be installed as any other tool, you could
very well build a Docker image that starts by installing Nix, and then uses Nix to install, in a reproducible manner, all the tools you need 
for your project.

There are also a series of Github Actions that you can use to install Nix on runners and build development environments. We will also look that.

## A first Nix expression

The following expression is the one that defines the development environment to build this book:

```
let
 pkgs = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/976fa3369d722e76f37c77493d99829540d43845.tar.gz") {};
 rpkgs = builtins.attrValues {
  inherit (pkgs.rPackages) quarto Ecdat devtools janitor plm pwt9 rio targets tarchetypes testthat tidyverse usethis formatR;
};
  tex = (pkgs.texlive.combine {
  inherit (pkgs.texlive) scheme-small amsmath framed fvextra environ fontawesome5 orcidlink pdfcol tcolorbox tikzfill;
});
 system_packages = builtins.attrValues {
  inherit (pkgs) R glibcLocalesUtf8 quarto;
};
  in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    LOCALE_ARCHIVE = if pkgs.system == "x86_64-linux" then  "${pkgs.glibcLocalesUtf8}/lib/locale/locale-archive" else "";
    LANG = "en_US.UTF-8";
    LC_ALL = "en_US.UTF-8";
    LC_TIME = "en_US.UTF-8";
    LC_MONETARY = "en_US.UTF-8";
    LC_PAPER = "en_US.UTF-8";
    LC_MEASUREMENT = "en_US.UTF-8";

    buildInputs = [  rpkgs tex system_packages  ];
      
  }
```

The first line imports a specfic hash of nixpkgs (pinning):

```
pkgs = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/976fa3369d722e76f37c77493d99829540d43845.tar.gz") {};
```

Then, I define the set of R packages that we require:

```
rpkgs = builtins.attrValues {
  inherit (pkgs.rPackages) quarto Ecdat devtools janitor plm pwt9 rio targets tarchetypes testthat tidyverse usethis formatR;
};
```

I then do something similar for LaTeX packages:

```
tex = (pkgs.texlive.combine {
  inherit (pkgs.texlive) scheme-small amsmath framed fvextra environ fontawesome5 orcidlink pdfcol tcolorbox tikzfill;
});
```

Finally, I define the set of "system" packages, so the R language itself, and Quarto (and glibcLocalesUtf8 to set the locale variables
to utf-8):

```
system_packages = builtins.attrValues {
  inherit (pkgs) R glibcLocalesUtf8 quarto;
};
```

Finally, all these definitions are used to define a *shell*:

```
in
pkgs.mkShell {
  LOCALE_ARCHIVE = if pkgs.system == "x86_64-linux" then "${pkgs.glibcLocalesUtf8}/lib/locale/locale-archive" else "";
  LANG = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_ALL = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_TIME = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_MONETARY = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_PAPER = "en_US.UTF-8";
  LC_MEASUREMENT = "en_US.UTF-8";

  buildInputs = [rpkgs tex system_packages];
}
```

In this block, a Nix shell environment is defined using pkgs.mkShell. The LOCALE_ARCHIVE variable is conditionally set based on the system architecture. 
Several environment variables (LANG, LC_ALL, LC_TIME, LC_MONETARY, LC_PAPER, and LC_MEASUREMENT) are set to "en_US.UTF-8". 
The buildInputs attribute specifies the list of inputs needed for this shell environment, which includes the three sets defined above: R packages (rpkgs), 
TeX packages (tex), and system packages (system_packages).

This Nix expression defines a development environment with specific R and TeX packages, system packages, and locale settings. 
When this expression is evaluated using Nix, it will generate a shell environment that includes all the specified dependencies, 
allowing you to work with R and TeX in a controlled and reproducible environment.

This environment can be built using the `nix-build` command, and users can then *drop* into that shell using `nix-shell`. 

Writing these Nix expressions is not easy, and there is a lot of boilerplate code. To simplify the process of writing these expressions,
a package I wrote, called `{rix}`, can help you.

## The {rix} package

{rix} is an R package that provides functions to help you write Nix expressions: these expressions can then be used by the Nix package manager to
build completely reproducible development environments. These environments can be used for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD environment. 
Environments built with Nix contain R and all the required packages that you need for your project: there are currently more than 80.000 pieces of software 
available through the Nix package manager, including the entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor packages. The Nix package manager is extremely powerful: not only it handles 
all the dependencies of any package extremely well, it is also possible with it to reproduce environments containing old releases of software. It is thus possible to build 
environments that contain R version 4.0.0 (for example) to run an old project originally developed on that version of R.

First, you need to install the Nix package manager on your system. For this, we are going to use the installer from [Determinate Systems](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer).
Simply run the following command in a terminal:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

If you wish to uninstall Nix, run the same command. Then, if you already have R installed on your system, you can install the `{rix}` package using:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("rix", repos = c("https://b-rodrigues.r-universe.dev",
  "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

From there, you can start a new R session and try out `{rix}` like so:

```{r, eval = F}
rix(r_ver = "latest",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    system_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "other",
    project_path = ".",
    overwrite = TRUE)
```

this will create a `default.nix` file in the project root. Open a terminal where `default.nix` is, and run `nix-build`. This will create a file called `result` in the same folder.
You can now *drop* into a shell with the specified packages using `nix-shell`.

## Running a pipeline with Nix

Once you’ve built and environment, and "dropped" into it, it’s possible to run R by simply typing `R` in the console. If instead you’ve installed an IDE, you can start
is as well by typing the IDE name’s. You can then work interactively with your data. But it is also possible to run a command from that environment. For instance,
if you have a `{targets}` pipeline that you wish to run in an environment built with Nix, you could run the following command (inside the folder containing the
`default.nix` file):

```
nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'"
```

This will run the pipeline and build the output. If the output is a rendered Quarto document for instance, you will then see the document appear in the specified output folder.

## CI/CD with Nix

It is also possible to run a `{targets}` pipeline on Github Actions quite easily. Run `rix::tar_nix_ga()` to add the file `.github/workflows/run-pipeline.yaml` to your project. 
Now, each time you push changes to your Github repository, the pipeline will be executed. Don’t forget to give read and write rights to the Github Actions bot. You will find
the outputs of the pipeline in the `targets-run` branch of your repository. See this [repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/chronicler_targets_pipeline) for an example.
