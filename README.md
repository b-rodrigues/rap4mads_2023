# Reproducible Analytical Pipelines - Master of Data Science

This is the 2023 edition of the course. If you’re looking for the 2022 edition:  https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4mads

I wrote an entire book on the subject that you can read here: https://raps-with-r.dev/
The book goes much deeper than the course obviously.

This repository contains the files of the bookdown I use to teach "Reproducible Analytical Pipelines" in the master’s of data science at the University of Luxembourg.

You can find the bookdown [here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rap4mads_2023/). 

I make a lot of references to my other bookdown, [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://modern-rstats.eu/).

I think you can benefit from reading this bookdown even if you’re not a student of the master’s of data science. I go through the basics of what you need
to know in order to set up a RAP -- a reproducible analytical pipeline.

For any questions, just open an issue on this repository.

You can render the book locally: start by forking the repo and clone your fork, then after having installed the Nix package manager, drop into a Nix shell using `nix-shell` and then run `quarto render`.
